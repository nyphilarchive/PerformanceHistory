# New York Philharmonic Performance History
The New York Philharmonic played its first concert on December 7, 1842. Since then, it has merged with the New York Symphony, the New/National Symphony, and had a long-running summer season at New York's Lewisohn Stadium. This [Performance History database](http://archives.nyphil.org/performancehistory) documents all known concerts of all of these organizations, amounting to more than 20,000 performances. The [New York Philharmonic Leon Levy Digital Archives](http://archives.nyphil.org) provides an additional interface for searching printed programs alongside other digitized items such as marked music scores, marked orchestral parts, business records, and photos.

In an effort to make this data available for study, analysis, and reuse, the New York Philharmonic joins organizations like [The Tate](https://github.com/tategallery/collection) and the <a href="http://www.cooperhewitt.org/">Cooper-Hewitt Smithsonian National Design Museum</a> in making its own contribution to the Open Data movement.

## Considerations
* A **program** is defined as one or more performances or presentations in which the same **repertoire**, **conductors**, and **soloists** are EXACTLY the same (dates, times, locations may vary within). For example, if a soloist plays an encore one night but not another, the concert with the encore becomes a different program.
* ~~Only complete titles are included. If an excerpt or movement is performed, this will not be indicated in the database at this time. We are working to include this in the near future.~~ Movements are now included as cataloged by NYP. Keep in mind that we do not necessarily catalog every movement in the work, only movements that we have ever performed.
* To see detailed information about our internal descriptive standards, please go to http://archives.nyphil.org/index.php/help-performancehistory.

## Repository Contents
The data is currently available as both XML and JSON. In the top‑level `Programs` directory you will find:
- `Programs/xml` — canonical XML files (`complete.xml` and segmented ranges)
- `Programs/json` — JSON equivalents of the XML

Only these canonical data outputs are tracked in Git. Raw Solr export files in `pre-transform/` are ignored.
For updating the dataset, see `MAINTAINERS.md`. All scripts and tools live under `Scripts/` and `tools/` to keep the repository root focused on the data.
The XML is structured in the following way:

```
<programs>
   <program>
      <id/> // GUID
      <programID/> // NYP Local ID
      <orchestra/>
      <season/>  
      <concertInfo> // A program can have multiple concerts
         <eventType/>
         <Location/>
         <Venue/>
         <Date/>
         <Time/>
      </concertInfo>
      <worksInfo> // a program will usually have multiple works 
         <work ID=""> // e.g. "1234*1" - first part is the Work ID, second part is the NYP Movement ID
             <composerName/>
             <workTitle/>
             <movement/>
             <conductorName/>     
             <soloists> // included only if there are listed soloists
                <soloist>
                    <soloistName/>
                    <soloistInstrument/> 
                    <soloistRole/>   		 
                </soloist>
             </soloists>
             <interval/> // intermissions are listed among works, but with a distinct interval tag
         </work>
      </worksInfo>
   </program>
</programs>
```

The JSON is formatted almost the same, with a few small differences in
naming:

```

  "programs": [
    {
      "id": "38e072a7-8fc9-4f9a-8eac-3957905c0002", // GUID

            },

          ]
        },
        /* a program will usually have multiple works */
        {
